# Business-Analytics-Project
### Project Purpose:
Design and implement a visual data exploration environment for the client: Great Place to Work Australia. This interactive visual environment will enable the client and its stakeholders to visually explore Best Workplaces in Australia (2021 – 2023).

### Project resources:
Main source of data for this project comes the publicly available data ‘Best Workplaces in Australia’ from 2021 – 2023 available on the Client’s web site. In addition to the main source of data, you are required to find and ethically harvest data from at least one more data source, which is relevant for the project.

### Project specification:
To design and implement a visual data exploration environment (VA application) for the client, you need to focus on decision-making needs of three different design personas, as
specified below (in Task 1). Design personas are different types of users grouped together into the so-called “archetypes” (Godwin, 2009). Archetypes are typically built/designed after in-depth observations of work practices and interviews with potential users. Each resulting persona is designed to represent a fictional character whose profile sums up the features of a whole (existing) group of similar users, for example in a similar professional role (Godwin, 2009). Therefore, each persona represents a much more than a typical user. Consequently, by practicing designing thinking in this project, you will go well beyond a typical software design phase called ‘elicitation of user requirements’. Personas are often named to emphasise human-centred design thinking. However, they do not represent a single (named) user but cumulative characteristics of a group of people (i.e. in a certain professional role) whose decision-making needs have been considered.

### Your tasks:

**Step 1: Design of personas**

You are required to design three personas to represent three archetypes of stakeholders (decision-makers) who would benefit from visual exploration of data from the annual lists
of Best Workplaces in Australia. Out of 3 personas, one persona is given (please see below) and the remaining 2 need to be selected and designed by your group. When designing these personas consider the Client’s needs, requirements and aspirations as well as the needs of different stakeholders, including their current and potential customers. Make sure that your designs are ‘needs-driven’ and ‘opportunity-driven’ rather than ‘data-driven’.

For all three personas, you are required to state three non-trivial questions they will be able to answer by using your DV application. For example, a question such as “Visualise the Best
Workplaces, which are located in Sydney” is considered to be trivial. Non-trivial questions have a potential to offer to the client something useful in the context of their work, interesting, insightful, creative and even unexpected. Non-trivial questions may include additional sources of publicly available data (e.g. from LinkedIn, companies’ web sites) and
combine them with your main data set.

An example of a design template:

Persona 1| “MQBS BA Graduate - Stephanie”
----------|----------------------
Role | Recent MQBS Graduate looking for a graduate position
Context of their work/role | Major in Business Analytics; <br> Graduated in July 2024
Key activities/ decision-making needs and interests | While at MQ completed an internship in a major bank <br> After graduation joined ACS and the MQBS Women in Data & Analytics <br> Interested in purpose-driven companies <br> Not aware of the ‘Great Companies to Work For’ web site <br> Open to interstate work opportunities <br><add other relevant key activities and decision-making needs> 
DV Questions | <three questions about the “Great Companies to Work for” particular persona would like answered through visual data exploration: <br> Question 1: <br> Question 2: <br> Question 3: 

**Step 2: Analyse and Harvest Data**

In this step, you need to “harvest” data from your main data source and store the resulting data records in an Excel file. Instead of being given a ready-made data set in Excel, you need
to figure out how to create it in the most effective way. The resulting Excel file needs to show metadata as well as the corresponding records of all companies featured in Best
Workplaces 2021 – 2023. 

**Step 3: Design of a DV application (visual data exploration environment) to answer the stated questions**

Using the Excel file from Step 2 import your data set (metadata and the actual records) into Tableau (or other DV software platform). After importing your data into the DV software platform, proceed to answer all questions for the three personas, as stated in your design templates (in Step 1).

**Step 4: Reflection-on-action**

This important step requires you to “step-back” and consider your design in broader organisational and societal context, in order to recognise and prevent possible syntactic, semantic and pragmatic data quality issues, data ethics and visual ethics issues as well as recognise and prevent potential unintended data harm. Careful consideration of these issues is of the outmost importance to the client, to our university, and to your future professional practice in any context.

This step includes the following considerations:
- Data quality (DQ): Discuss your approach to handling data quality, including prevention of syntactic, semantic and/or pragmatic data quality issues. Advise the client about potential DQ issues they need to be aware of.
- Data ethics: Use the PAPA framework to identify and analyse any data-related ethical issues that need to be considered in your project. Even if you think that your use of data and implementation of the DV application do not pose any ethical risks, you are still required to demonstrate your analysis of ethical issues and inform the client about your findings.
- Visual ethics: Discuss your approach to handling any potential visual ethics issues in your project. Advise the client about any potential visual ethics issues that could arise during their own visual data exploration (e.g. use of time filters).
- Application of “Do No Harm” principles and guidelines in data visualisation: Use the provided “Do No Harm” resources to identify different guidelines relevant to your project and discuss their application.
- Impact: consider potential performative impact of your visual data exploration environment, including unintended consequences.
